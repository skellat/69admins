New Year's Day 2024 Special?  What New Year's Day 2024 Special?  We're back for *New Year's Eve 2023* instead!  

The world changed a bit too much since we started the hiatus.  In this episode we talk about the horror of a coming news channel that only has AI-generated characters for anchors as well as the financial instability and panic among the big traditional content conglomerates in the United States.
