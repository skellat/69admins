This week's episode opens with a quick discussion inspired by [a post seen on the BlueSky social network](https://bsky.app/profile/nkalamb.bsky.social/post/3krntfocnsc2l).  We are against bureaucrats of all types doing stupid, unthinking, uncaring things.  We strongly support the [Very Short Introduction](https://academic.oup.com/very-short-introductions) series of books from Oxford University Press and encourage you to pick up an item from your local library to read today.

We discussed a few news stories in this episode.  We especially discussed why content creators *should not* be using Google at this time if they can help it.
