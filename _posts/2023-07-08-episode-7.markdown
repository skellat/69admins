We catch up with our planning syllabus in this episode.  Before we dive into our main topic we touch upon the current strike by the Writers Guild of America-West and how the Screen Actors Guild may join them in the week ahead in terms of being on strike.  We also discuss in the first half the misadventure of the film *Crater* and what that means for the media landscape.  After the mid-way break we talk about the differences between subscription video on-demand, ad-supported video on-demand, free ad-supported streaming television, and virtual cable providers.  We also provide our pick of the fortnight.
