This is a preview episode as a story came up before we were ready to start with regular episodes.  In this story we talk about how connection is important as to streaming television.  A major wind storm impacted northeast Ohio and caused blackouts not just of power but also Internet service.  Service failures in both domains are not helpful for having success in enjoying streaming television.

Regular episodes will begin April 15th, 2023.
