In this episode we take a look at implementing the use of an antenna to get broadcast television.  We talk about why you still wind up with streaming television on your wireless mobile device instead of tuning in your local broadcast station.  We also mention a product of the past, FLO TV.  Reporting is also made as to the Writers Guild of America strike and the debt ceiling crisis in Washington, DC.
