Inspired by [a Mastodon post made by Evan Prodromou](https://cosocial.ca/@evan/110706952627326294), we have a bonus special episode on the first day of the SAG-AFTRA 2023 strike.  The episode discusses the situation, offers suggestions to listeners such as visiting comics shops as well as checking out "actual play" programs like Critical Role, and suggests that listeners get ready for a long haul situation.
