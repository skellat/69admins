In light of a world where strikes by writers and actors seem to be ceaseless we end up talking about *free* streaming possibilities that are out there.  There are possibilities in the mix that services that exist today might not exist 90 days from now.  As our world spirals we have to be ready to adapt to changes around us.  Don't collaborate with scabs such as the various talk show hosts that are back to work without writers.  Enjoy the rich cultural history shown in the television of the past as a stopgap while the strikes continue.
