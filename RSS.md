You can listen to us via [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/69-admins/id1677957335), [Amazon Music](https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/8530b7ce-f747-4d62-a539-8ef073b4531f/69-admins), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5uqhIwH6LATsLg5UPGiVju), [iHeart Podcasts](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/110944673/), and [through RSS in whatever podcast client you choose](https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/6410a80dec813e00110faed2).  You can use [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) as a text-based podcast client, for example, via its [podboat](https://newsboat.org/releases/2.28/docs/newsboat.html#_podcast_support) tool.

We support using RSS to follow this site itself although you won't receive episodes directly that way.  Feel free to [subscribe to the site itself via RSS]({{site.baseurl}}/feed.xml) in your feed reader.  Don't have a feed reader?  We strongly suggest using great tools like [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/), and [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/).  Other tools out there that you might be able to locate that could be great, too.
